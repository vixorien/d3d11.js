		// Start by creating ID3D11Device object, which is in charge
		// of creating resources (textures, buffers, etc.) for D3D11.
		//  - It requires a canvas HTML element that will act as its "graphics adapter"
		let device = D3D11CreateDevice(document.getElementById("viewport"));

		// Once a device has been created, we can get an ID3D11DeviceContext
		// object from it, which contains rendering and pipeline functions
		let context = device.GetImmediateContext();

		// Lastly, we create an IDXGISwapChain which houses the back buffer
		// and allows us to finalize a single frame of rendering.
		//  - This requires a swap chain description, which describes the
		//    size of the back buffer for rendering and its color format
		const swapDesc = new DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_DESC(800, 600, DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM);
		let swapChain = DXGICreateSwapChain(device, swapDesc);

		// Now that we have a swap chain, we can make a Render Target View for
		// its internal back buffer, allowing us to render into it.
		//  - We *could* pass in a description of the RTV we'd like, but passing
		//    null creates a default RTV that has access to the first subresource
		let swapBuffer = swapChain.GetBuffer(); // Also adds 1 to the buffer's reference count
		let backBufferRTV = device.CreateRenderTargetView(swapBuffer, null);
		swapBuffer.Release(); // Releases 1 reference to the buffer

		// Set this RTV as our rendering context's render target
		//  - Multiple render targets are possible, so the function takes an array of RTVs
		//  - No depth buffer for this demo, so setting that to null
		context.OMSetRenderTargets([backBufferRTV], null);

		// Clear the back buffer to a specified color
		let cornflowerBlue = [0.39, 0.58, 0.93, 1];
		context.ClearRenderTargetView(backBufferRTV, cornflowerBlue);

		// Present the frame to the user
		swapChain.Present();
